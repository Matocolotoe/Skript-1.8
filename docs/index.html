<p> <span style="font-size: 60px; font-weight: bold;">Skript</span> is (surprise, surprise) a scripting plugin for the Bukkit platform. It is easy to use for
    simple tasks, but you can also create really complex things with it. The syntax of Skript is close to
    English, but it is still not magic. While you might succeed with experimentation for simple tasks, for
    anything more complex you will need some guidance. </p>
<p> This is Skript's documentation. You will find all supported features of the plugin here, along with some
    useful examples. We don't have tutorials yet, but you can find good ones using whatever search engine you
    prefer. </p>

<p class="box"> <strong>We are looking for docs authors!</strong> Currently, the only documentation is generated
    automatically. It would be nice to have some hand-written content such as tutorials on the docs as well. For
    example, currently we don't have a tutorial on how to use loops here; This makes it harder for newcomers to
    learn. Check <a href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/issues/611">this issue</a> for more details and
    if you're interested in helping out. </p>
