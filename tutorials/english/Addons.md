# Addons

Some addons require particular modifications to work with Skript-1.8. Here are a few recommandations about some of them.

- **SkBee** : use version 1.10.2, available on
  the [official repository](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee/releases/tag/1.10.2)
- **SkQuery** : if you're using Skript 2.5.3 or less, you can download a patched version
  [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697442955555897394/697456620774359110/SkQueryLime.jar) ; if you're using
  Skript 2.6+, you can download a patched version on the [repository](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/SkQuery-1.8/) that
  I have created
- **TuSKe** : try to avoid using it, since it is no longer maintained,
  use [skript-gui](https://github.com/APickledWalrus/skript-gui/)
  instead ; if you still need it, you can download a patched
  version [here](https://skripttools.net/dl/TuSKe+1.8.3-PikachuPatch-v3.jar)
- **WildSkript** : try to avoid using it, since it is no longer maintained, and it breaks Skript 2.6+
