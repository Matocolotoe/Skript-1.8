Skript is a plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people
to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you
*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used
for prototyping etc.

This GitHub fork of Skript is based on the SkriptLang fork, based on Mirreski's improvements
which was built on Njol's original Skript.

## Requirements
Skript requires **Spigot** to work. You heard it right, Bukkit does *not* work.
Paper is usable but not really recommended for 1.8 or older.

This fork of Skript is only available for Minecraft 1.8. Check above if you're
looking for 1.9+ compatibility.

Also, it doesn't support hooks to FAWE or WorldGuard yet.
