Skript is a plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you
*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used for prototyping etc.

This GitHub fork of Skript is based on the SkriptLang fork, based on Mirreski's improvements, which were built on Njol's original Skript.

## Requirements
Skript-1.8 requires **Spigot 1.8.8** (not Spigot 1.8.0, 1.8.3, ...) to work, and you heard it right, Bukkit does *not* work.

This fork is only available for Minecraft 1.8. Check above if you're looking for a version compatible with Minecraft 1.9+. Furthermore :

- Some addons require a special version compatible with 1.8, see the [tutorial for addons](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/blob/master/tutorials/english/Addons.md).
- If you were using Skript 2.2, your code needs to be slightly changed, see the [tutorial for scripts](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/blob/master/tutorials/english/Updates.md).

## Download
You can find the downloads in the [releases page](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/releases).

## Documentation
Documentation is available [here](https://skriptlang.github.io/Skript) for the latest version of Skript.

## Issues and other stuff
Since this fork only provides retro-compatibility, issues regarding Skript will have to be posted
on the [official repository](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) of the plugin.

However, don't hesitate to report any problem which you believe directly related to
the plugin by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/issues).
