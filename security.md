# Security Document
See also [code conventions](code-conventions.md); there are a few guidelines
about security of added code there.

## Reporting security issues
Security issues may be reported to core team members privately e.g. on Discord.
Note that this applies *only* to security issues; everything else should still
be posted to issue tracker.

Publicly posting security issues is also allowed, because not everyone has or
wants a Discord account. We may add other channels for private reports in
future.

## Team guidelines
Everyone with push access must use two-factor authentication for their GitHub
accounts. Should their account still be compromised, other team members should
be immediately notified.
